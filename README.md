# Whatsapp-chats-sentiment-analyser
Data analysis of whatsapp chats and using NLP tools to determine the sentiments of the chats


## Right now project is able to perform basic data anaylsis tasks on the whatsapp chats.
>#### To export a whatsapp chat:
``` go to desired chat -> option (three dots) -> more -> export chats ```

Then you can upload the chats on the web app to see the anyalsis of your chats.
If you do not have any chats you can download the sample chats from the [Sample Data](https://github.com/BraveStone9/Whatsapp-chats-sentiment-analyser/tree/main/Sample%20Data) folder.

You can visit the project hosted on Heroku by [clicking here](https://wtsp-chat-sentiment-analyser.herokuapp.com/).

## Currently I am working on a NLP machine learning model which will be able to perform sentiment anaylsis on the whatsapp chats.
